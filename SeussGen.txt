built a radio-phone. I put in a quick call.                                                   
I called all my brothers and uncles and aunts

built a radio-phone. I put in a quick call.

was working full tilt.                                                                        
We were all knitting Thneeds                                                                  
just as busy as bees,                                                                         
to the sound of the chopping                                                                  
of Truffula Trees.                                                                            
Then...                                                                                       
Oh! Baby! Oh!                                                                                 
How my business did grow!                                                                     
Now, chopping one tree                                                                        
at a time                                                                                     
was too slow.                                                                                 
So I quickly invented my Super-Axe-Hacker                                                     
which whacked off four Truffula Trees at one smacker.                                         
We were making Thneeds                                                                        
four times as fast as before!                                                                 
And that Lorax?... He didn't show up any more.                                                
But the next week                                                                             
he knocked                                                                                    
on my new office door.                                                                        
He snapped, I'm the Lorax who speaks for the trees                                            
which you seem to be chopping as fast as you please.                                          
But I'm also in charge of the Brown Bar-ba-loots                                              
frisking about in their Bar-ba-loot suits                                                     
and happily lived, eating Truffula Fruits.                                                    
NOW...thanks to your hacking my trees to the ground,                                         
 there's not enough Truffula Fruit to go 'round.                                               
And my poor Bar-ba-loots are all getting the crummies                                         
because they have gas, and no food, in their tummies!                                         
They loved living here. But I can't let them stay.                                            
They'll have to find food. And I hope that they may.                                          
Good luck, boys, he cried. And he sent them away.                                             
I, the Once-ler, felt sad as I watched them all go.                                           
BUT... business is business!  And business must grow                                          
regardless of crummies in tummies, you know.                                                  
I meant no harm. I most truly did not.                                                        
But I had to grow bigger. So bigger I got.                                                    
I biggered my factory. I biggered my roads.                                                   
I biggered my wagons. I biggered the loads                                                    
of the Thneeds I shipped out. I was shipping them forth                                       
to the South! To the East! To the West! To the North!                                         
I went right on biggering...selling more Thneeds.                                             
And I biggered my money, which everyone needs.                                                
Then again he came back! I was fixing some pipes                                              
when that old nuisance Lorax came back with more gripes.                                      
I am the Lorax, he coughed and he whiffed.                                                    
He sneezed and he snuffled. He snarggled. He sniffed.                                         
Once-ler! he cried with a cruffulous croak.                                                   
Once-ler! You're making such smogulous smoke!                                                 
My poor Swomee-Swans...why, they can't sing a note!                                           
No one can sing who has smog in his throat.                                                   
And so, said the Lorax,  --please pardon my cough--                                           
they cannot live here.   So I'm sending them off. Oh, their future is dreary.                 
They'll walk on their fins and get woefully weary                                             
in search of some water that isn't so smeary.                                                 
And then I got mad. I got terribly mad.                                                       
I yelled at the Lorax, Now listen here, Dad!                                                  
All you do is yap-yap and say, Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad!                                            
Well, I have my rights, sir, and I'm telling you                                              
I intend to go on doing just what I do!                                                       
And, for your information, you Lorax, I'm figgering on biggering                              
and BIGGERING and BIGGERING,                                                                  
turning MORE Truffula Trees into Thneeds                                                      
which everyone, EVERYONE, EVERYONE needs!                                                     
And at that very moment, we heard a loud whack!                                               
From outside in the fields came a sickening smack                                             
of an axe on a tree. Then we heard the tree fall.                                             
The very last Truffula Tree of them all!                                                      
No more trees. No more Thneeds. No more work to be done.                                      
So, in no time, my uncles and aunts, every one,                                               
all waved me good-bye. They jumped into my cars                                               
and drove away under the smoke-smuggered stars.                                               
Now all that was left 'neath the bad-smelling sky                                             
was my big empty factory...  the Lorax... and I.                                              
The Lorax said nothing. Just gave me a glance...                                              
just gave me a very sad, sad backward glance...                                               
as he lifted himself by the seat of his pants.                                                
And I'll never forget the grim look on his face                                               
when he heisted himself and took leave of this place,                                         
through a hole in the smog, without leaving a trace.                                          
And all that the Lorax left here in this mess                                                 
was a small pile of rocks, with one word...                                                   
UNLESS. Whatever that meant, well, I just couldn't guess.                                     
That was long, long ago. But each day since that day                                          
I've sat here and worried and worried away.                                                   
Through the years, while my buildings                                                         
have fallen apart, I've worried about it                                                      
with all of my heart. But now, says the Once-ler,                                             
Now that you're here, the word of the Lorax seems perfectly clear.                            
UNLESS someone like you cares a whole awful lot,                                              
nothing is going to get better.   It's not. SO...                                             
Catch! calls the Once-ler. He lets something fall.                                             
It's a Truffula Seed. It's the last one of all!                                               
You're in charge of the last of the Truffula Seeds.                                           
And Truffula Trees are what everyone needs.                                                    
Plant a new Truffula. Treat it with care.                                                     
Give it clean water. And feed it fresh air.                                                   
Grow a forest. Protect it from axes that hack.                                                
Then the Lorax and all of his friends may come back.                                          
he knocked                                                                                    
on my new office door.                                                                        
He snapped, I'm the Lorax who speaks for the trees                                            
which you seem to be chopping as fast as you please.                                          
But I'm also in charge of the Brown Bar-ba-loots                                              
frisking about in their Bar-ba-loot suits                                                     
as they played in the shade in their Bar-ba-loot suits                                        
and happily lived, eating Truffula Fruits.                                                    
NOW...thanks to your hacking my trees to the ground,                                          
there's not enough Truffula Fruit to go 'round.                                               
And my poor Bar-ba-loots are all getting the crummies                                         
because they have gas, and no food, in their tummies!                                         
They loved living here. But I can't let them stay.                                            
They'll have to find food. And I hope that they may.                                          
Good luck, boys, he cried. And he sent them away.                                             
I, the Once-ler, felt sad as I watched them all go.                                           
BUT... business is business!  And business must grow                                          
regardless of crummies in tummies, you know.                                                  
I meant no harm. I most truly did not.                                                        
But I had to grow bigger. So bigger I got.                                                    
I biggered my factory. I biggered my roads.                                                   
I biggered my wagons. I biggered the loads                                                    
of the Thneeds I shipped out. I was shipping them forth                                       
to the South! To the East! To the West! To the North!                                         
I went right on biggering...selling more Thneeds.                                             
And I biggered my money, which everyone needs.                                                
Then again he came back! I was fixing some pipes                                              
when that old nuisance Lorax came back with more gripes.                                      
I am the Lorax, he coughed and he whiffed.                                                    
He sneezed and he snuffled. He snarggled. He sniffed.                                         
Once-ler! he cried with a cruffulous croak.                                                   
Once-ler! You're making such smogulous smoke!                                                 
My poor Swomee-Swans...why, they can't sing a note!                                           
No one can sing who has smog in his throat.                                                   
And so, said the Lorax,  --please pardon my cough--                                           
they cannot live here.   So I'm sending them off.                                             
Where will they go?... I don't hopefully know.                                                
They may have to fly for a month...or a year...                                               
To escape from the smog you've smogged-up around here.                                        
What's more, snapped the Lorax. (His dander was up.)                                          
Let me say a few words about Gluppity-Glupp.                                                  
Your machinery chugs on, day and night without stop                                           
making Gluppity-Glup. Also Schloppity-Schlopp.                                                
And what do you do with this leftover goo?...                                                 
I'll show you. You dirty old Once-ler man, you!                                               
You're glumping the pond where the Humming-Fish humming while splashing around.               
But those trees! Those trees!                                                                 
Those Truffula Trees!                                                                         
All my life I'd been searching for trees such as these.                                       
The touch of their tufts was much softer than silk.                                           
And they had the sweet smell of fresh butterfly milk.                                         
I felt a great leaping of joy in my heart.                                                    
I knew just what I'd do!                                                                     
I unloaded my cart.                                                                           
In no time at all, I had built a small shop.                                                  
Then I chopped down a Truffula Tree with one chop.                                            
And with great skillful skill and with great speedy speed,                                    
I took the soft tuft. And I knitted a Thneed!                                                 
The instand I'd finished, I heard a ga-Zump!                                                  
I looked.                                                                                     
I saw something pop out of the stump                                                          
of the tree I'd chopped down. It was sort of a man.                                           
Describe him?...That's hard. I don't know if I can.                                           
He was shortish. And oldish.                                                                  
And brownish. And mossy.                                                                      
And he spoke with a voice                                                                     
that was sharpish and bossy.                                                                  
Mister! he said with a sawdusty sneeze,                                                       
I am the Lorax. I speak for the trees.                                                        
I speak for the trees.                                                                        
I speak for the trees!                                                                        
I'm busy, I told him.                                                                         
Shut up, if you please.                                                                       
I rushed 'cross the room, and in no time at all,                                              
in the factory I built,                                                                       
the whole Once-ler Family to get mighty rich!                                                 
Get over here fast! Take the road to North Nitch.                                             
Turn left at Weehawken. Sharp right at South Stich.                                           
And, in no time at all,

And, in no time at all,                                                                       
built a radio-phone. I put in a quick call.                                                   
I called all my brothers and uncles and aunts                                                 
and I said, Listen here! Here's a wonderful chance                                            
for the whole Once-ler Family to get mighty rich!                                             
Get over here fast! Take the road to North Nitch.

built a radio-phone. I put in a quick call.

was working full tilt.                                                                        
We were all knitting Thneeds                                                                  
just as busy as bees,                                                                         
to the sound of the chopping                                                                  
of Truffula Trees.                                                                            
Then...                                                                                       
Oh! Baby! Oh!                                                                                 
How my business did grow!                                                                     
Now, chopping one tree                                                                        
at a time                                                                                     
was too slow.                                                                                 
So I quickly invented my Super-Axe-Hacker                                                     
which whacked off four Truffula Trees at one smacker.                                         
We were making Thneeds                                                                        
four times as fast as before!                                                                 
And that Lorax?... He didn't show up any more.                                                
But the next week                                                                             
he knocked                                                                                    
on my new office door.                                                                        
He snapped, I'm the Lorax who speaks for the trees                                            
which you seem t
